     - **Tax Management**: Develop basic tax calculation and application functionality.

3. **API Development**:
   - Develop APIs to interact with the front-end and other modules within eTamil niqi.
   - Ensure APIs are efficient and secure, allowing seamless data retrieval and transaction processing.

4. **Validation and Error Handling**:
   - Implement validation rules for financial data (e.g., debit/credit balance checks, account validation).
   - Develop robust error-handling mechanisms to ensure data integrity and user-friendly error reporting.

### **Phase 3: Application Development & Testing (Weeks 4-5)**

1. **Application Development**:
   - Build the user interface using React, focusing on usability and simplicity.
   - Develop forms and dashboards for managing accounts, journal entries, payments, invoices, and ledgers.
   - Implement reporting features to provide financial summaries and insights.

2. **Unit Testing**:

   - Test database interactions, API endpoints, and business logic thoroughly.

3. **Feature Testing**:
   - Conduct testing of individual features (e.g., account creation, journal entry posting) to validate their correctness.
   - Simulate common accounting scenarios to ensure the framework's reliability.

### **Phase 4: Refinement and Optimization (Week 6)**

1. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Optimize the database queries and Rust code for faster processing of transactions and report generation.
   - Minimize latency in API calls and ensure smooth data flow between the backend and the front-end.

2. **Final Adjustments**:
   - Make any necessary adjustments based on the initial testing feedback.
   - Refine the UI/UX to enhance user interaction and accessibility.

3. **Documentation**:
   - Prepare technical documentation for the framework, including API specifications, data models, and development guidelines.
   - Ensure documentation is clear and comprehensive for future development and maintenance.

### **Outcome:**

- **Week 1**: Completed requirement analysis and design phase.
- **Weeks 2-3**: Developed the core framework, including database, APIs, and backend logic.
- **Weeks 4-5**: Built and tested the application using React.
- **Week 6**: Optimized performance and finalized the framework for use in the eTamil niqi ERP.

This development plan outlines the key steps to rapidly build the Kanakkiyal accounting module framework, ensuring it is robust, efficient, and ready for integration into the broader eTamil niqi system.
